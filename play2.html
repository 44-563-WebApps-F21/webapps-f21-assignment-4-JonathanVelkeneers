        Yes! he shall.  Had he come himself, I admit I would
        have gone back to the life of degradation you and he had prepared for

        messenger—oh! it was infamous—infamous.

    <p class="erlynne speech">
        [_C._]  Lady Windermere, you wrong me horribly—you wrong
        your husband horribly.  He doesn't know you are here—he thinks you are
        safe in your own house.  He thinks you are asleep in your own room.  He
        never read the mad letter you wrote to him!

    <h5 class="windermere name">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>
    <p class="windermere speech">[_R._]  Never read it!</p>
    <h5 class="erlynne name">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h5>
    <p class="erlynne speech">No—he knows nothing about it.</p>
