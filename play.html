		<h2>LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN</h2>
		<h3>Lord Darlington's rooms</h3>
		<p>Act III opens in "Lord Darlington's rooms" with Lady Windermere. She is distraught, and gives a long monologue as she wonders where Lord Darlington is and whether she should return home to her husband.
			<br>Mrs. Erlynne finds her daughter at Lord Darlington's house and tries to convince her to return to her husband. Mrs. Erlynne reveals to Lady Windermere that she destroyed the note, meaning she can go home without fear that her husband already knows what she had planned. She also tries to convince her daughter that what she is doing is a mistake.
			<br>At first, Lady Windermere refuses to listen to Mrs. Erlynne, but when Mrs. Erlynne starts to talk about Lady Windermere's child, she decides to return home.
			<br>The two women are forced to hide when they hear Lord Darlington and other men returning home. Lady Windermere hides behind a curtain and Mrs. Erlynne quickly exits through a door.
			<br>Lord Windermere and Lord Arthur are also there. They talk at length about women, especially Mrs. Erlynne. They also talk about the concepts of gossip, marriage, goodness, and cynicism.
			<br>When Lord Windermere prepares to leave, he notices a fan belonging to his wife on a table and a quarrel breaks between Lord Windermere and Lord Darlington.
			<br>In the commotion, Mrs. Erlynne reveals herself, allowing Lady Windermere to escape unnoticed.

		<p class="windermere speech">[_Standing by the fireplace_.]  Why doesn't he come?
			This waiting is horrible.  He should be here.  Why is he not here, to
			wake by passionate words some fire within me?  I am cold—cold as a
			loveless thing.  Arthur must have read my letter by this time.  If he
			cared for me, he would have come after me, would have taken me back by
			force.  But he doesn't care.  He's entrammelled by this woman—fascinated
			by her—dominated by her.  If a woman wants to hold a man, she has merely
			to appeal to what is worst in him.  We make gods of men and they leave
			us.  Others make brutes of them and they fawn and are faithful.  How
			hideous life is! . . . Oh! it was mad of me to come here, horribly mad.
			And yet, which is the worst, I wonder, to be at the mercy of a man who
			loves one, or the wife of a man who in one's own house dishonours one?
			What woman knows?  What woman in the whole world?  But will he love me
			always, this man to whom I am giving my life?  What do I bring him?  Lips
			that have lost the note of joy, eyes that are blinded by tears, chill
			hands and icy heart.  I bring him nothing.  I must go back—no; I can't go
			back, my letter has put me in their power—Arthur would not take me back!
			That fatal letter!  No!  Lord Darlington leaves England to-morrow.  I
			will go with him—I have no choice.  [_Sits down for a few moments_.
			_Then starts up and puts on her cloak_.]  No, no!  I will go back, let
			Arthur do with me what he pleases.  I can't wait here.  It has been
			madness my coming.  I must go at once.  As for Lord Darlington—Oh! here
			he is!  What shall I do?  What can I say to him?  Will he let me go away
			at all?  I have heard that men are brutal, horrible . . . Oh!  [_Hides
			her face in her hands_.]

		<p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ MRS. ERLYNNE _L._]</p>
		<h5 class="erlynne name">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h5>
		<p class="erlynne speech">Lady Windermere!  [LADY WINDERMERE _starts and looks up_.
			_Then recoils in contempt_.]  Thank Heaven I am in time.  You must go
			back to your husband's house immediately.
		</p>
		<h5 class="windermere name">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>
		<p class="windermere speech">Must?</p>
		<h5 class="erlynne name">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h5>
		<p class="erlynne speech">[_Authoritatively_.]  Yes, you must!  There is not a
			second to be lost.  Lord Darlington may return at any moment.
		</p>
		<h5 class="windermere name">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>
		<p class="windermere speech">Don't come near me!</p>
		<h5 class="erlynne name">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h5>
		<p class="erlynne speech">Oh!  You are on the brink of ruin, you are on the brink of
			a hideous precipice.  You must leave this place at once, my carriage is
			waiting at the corner of the street.  You must come with me and drive
			straight home.
		</p>
		<p class="stage-direction">[LADY WINDERMERE _throws off her cloak and flings it on the sofa_.]</p>
		<p class="erlynne speech">What are you doing?</p>
		<h5 class="windermere name">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>
		<p class="windermere speech">Mrs. Erlynne—if you had not come here, I would have
			gone back.  But now that I see you, I feel that nothing in the whole
			world would induce me to live under the same roof as Lord Windermere.
			You fill me with horror.  There is something about you that stirs the
			wildest—rage within me.  And I know why you are here.  My husband sent
			you to lure me back that I might serve as a blind to whatever relations
			exist between you and him.
		</p>
		<h5 class="erlynne name">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h5>
		<p class="erlynne speech">Oh!  You don't think that—you can't.</p>
		<h5 class="windermere name">LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>
		<p class="windermere speech">Go back to my husband, Mrs. Erlynne.  He belongs to you
			and not to me.  I suppose he is afraid of a scandal.  Men are such
			cowards.  They outrage every law of the world, and are afraid of the
			world's tongue.  But he had better prepare himself.  He shall have a
			scandal.  He shall have the worst scandal there has been in London for
			years.  He shall see his name in every vile paper, mine on every hideous
			placard.
